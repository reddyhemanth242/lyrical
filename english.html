  <h3>english lyrics</h3>
  <h4>I recollect that my first exploit <br>in squirrel-shooting was in a grove <br> of tall walnut-trees that shades one side <br> of the valley. I had wandered into it <br> at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet,<br> and was startled by
    the roar of my own gun,<br> as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and <br> was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes.<br>
